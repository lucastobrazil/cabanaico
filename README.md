# Cabanaico

Cabanaico is the icon library used in the [Cabana Design System](https://www,cabanadesignsystem.com). It takes a folder of SVG icons (some from the excellent [Symbolicons](http://symbolicons.com), adds some custom icons and exports them all as React components. This library could not be possible without the awesome work of the Small Improvements Open Source team - particularly [Featherico](https://github.com/SmallImprovements-OpenSource/featherico).

## Usage

```
npm install cabanaico
```

```js
import { IconActivityRings } from 'cabanaico';

// <IconActivityRings />
```
